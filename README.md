# Welcome to Imaginary elections friend! 


## What is this?

Imaginary elections friend is an app that can be used to calculate [parliamentary apportioment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_(politics)) from election results.

## Who is it for?

Likely the only people who will find this useful are [r/imaginaryelections](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginaryelections/), a subreddit dedidcated to... well, imaginary elections. Elections in alternative timelines, fictional universes, and what-ifs, in the future, past, present.

## Wait that's a thing?

Appearantly!

## Why did you make this?

Mostly to learn [React](https://react.dev/). And because when I showed r/imaginaryelections screenshots, they asked when will it be published.

## Is there a user tutorial?

Not right now, but maybe in the future. For now, I hope it's user-friendly enough.

## Are there more features planned? Are you taking notes?

Yes, there are more features plan. You can give me your notes on the dedidcated reddit post (link will be here - if you're seeing this message, give me a bit of time to update this!).Sadly, not every idea will be made. For example, I was asked to support [Single Transferrable Vote method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote), which I don't think will likely go well with how this app works.

## So there will definitely be further versions?

No promises, but maybe.

## Some things aren't aligned properly

Yes, I'm not much of an expert on [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), yet. However, improved design is on the list of planned updated.

## And it doesn't work on my phone!

Yes, support for mobile is also currently in the TODO pile, and may or not be done soon. In the meantime, it's advised to use on a computer. Sorry!

## Are you taking [pull-requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control#Pull_requests)?

I don't know. Maybe.

It's a crutch, but... OK that's enough from you.
